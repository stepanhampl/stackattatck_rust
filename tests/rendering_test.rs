    // This is a placeholder for a real test that would use a mock context
    // Since we can't easily create a graphics context in unit tests,
    // we'll skip this test by default
    
    // In a real test, we would:
    // 1. Create a mock Context
    // 2. Create a mock Canvas 
    // 3. Call draw_grid
    // 4. Assert that the appropriate methods were called on Canvas
